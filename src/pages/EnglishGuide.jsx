            Kyotei (競艇) — Japanese boat racing — is one of Japan&apos;s four
            government-sanctioned betting sports, running nearly every day at 24
            venues across the country. Six hydroplane boats race three laps
            around a 600m course, and you can bet on the outcome. This guide
            takes you from zero knowledge to reading AI predictions like a
            local.

          <h2>🔑 The One Thing to Know: Lane 1 Wins Half the Time</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike most racing sports, Kyotei has a massive positional bias. The
            boat starting from
            <strong>
              {" "}
              lane 1 (the innermost course) wins roughly 50% of all races
              nationwide
            </strong>{" "}
            — because it takes the shortest line around the first turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost everything in Kyotei prediction revolves around one question:
            <strong>
              {" "}
              will lane 1 hold, or will someone take it down?
            </strong>{" "}
            BoatAI&apos;s &quot;Lane-1 upset index&quot; measures exactly this
            for every race.

          <p>
            All ~1,600 professional racers are ranked into four classes,
            reviewed twice a year. Class is a strong predictor of performance:
          </p>
          <ul className="eg-list">
            <li>
              <strong>A1</strong> — The elite (top ~20%). An A1 racer in lane 1
              is a formidable favorite.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A2</strong> — Strong senior racers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>B1</strong> — The mid-tier majority.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>B2</strong> — Rookies and lower-ranked racers.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="eg-note">
            Women race alongside men in the same races — Kyotei is one of the
            few sports where both compete directly.
